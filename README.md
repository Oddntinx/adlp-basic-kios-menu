A really basic restaurant kiosk menu

This is just a really basic restaurant kiosk menu in console writtern in Java. Made to comply with the requirements (utilizing data structures) of my program this semester. You may use this as reference of how bad I am, or on your program, and or just straight-up copy it (provided that you follow the liscense).
